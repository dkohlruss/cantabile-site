          <h2>
            Cantabile is an adjective, meaning songlike,
            or in a smooth, flowing, lyrical style.
          </h2>
          <p>
            In December 2005, a small group of singers assembled to perform at
            Habitat for Humanity Christmas Concert in La Connor, Washington.  Out of
            that original group, Cantabile was formed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Cantabile has grown to become a 20-member ensemble of auditioned
            vocalists gathered from the Skagit Valley area. The group performs
            Christmas and spring concerts of sacred and secular works. We enjoy
            performing classical music that has withstood the test of time, and
            experimenting with contemporary selections that challenge us and
            entertain our audiences. Our mission is to share our love of
            beautiful choral music with audiences throughout the Skagit Valley
            area and beyond.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cantabile’s purpose each season is to enhance the community’s
            enjoyment and understanding of choral arts through communicating the
            beauty of music. The group has been honored to support Skagit Opera,
            Skagit Valley Chorale, Skagit Symphony, and other performing arts
            groups, through members’ active participation in their productions
            and concerts. We are pleased to be working in collaboration with the
            Anacortes Arts Foundation. We look forward to seeing you and your
            family at our inspiring concerts.</p>

          <p>
            Cantabile singers come from all walks of life. Choral experience in an advanced ensemble is highly desirable. Formal voice study is not required, but all members are expected to be able to sing musically, on pitch, in accurate rhythm, and to have moderate to advanced sight reading ability. Singers are expected to have a good reading knowledge of musical notation, and some familiarity singing in foreign languages is a bonus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Singers from all sections are welcome to audition. During an audition, a singer will be judged by their intonation, musical ear, vocal excellence, and aptitude for learning.  Rehearsals are Monday evenings from 6:30 to 9:00 p.m at Bethany Covenant Church in Mt. Vernon. Interested singers are very welcome to attend a rehearsal, to determine whether they wish to schedule an audition.
